Hello there!
This is my 1st attempt at a tiny little python project.
And if you are also in my shoes, you would have probably,like me, done a google search to see what are the most common beginner-friendly python projects one can do.
And chances are, that you must have seen a tiny little game called *Guess The Number*, where the program uses the random header to generate a random number and asks you to guess it in a certain number of chances.
And today, since I was feeling a little adventurous, I decided to turn this game upside down, by letting you be in control, and letting the computer to guess what number you have  thought of. Sounds fun!

*Instructions:*
Nothing as such, follow the on-screen commands when you run it.


*Complexities and loop-holes yet to be fixed:*
I have been trying to implement bigger range of random digits, but somehow, unable to find an efficient way to do it yet, as it is taking up a lot of time and space complexity. I must be doing something wrong. But don't worry, the current version will surely guess your number.
Your response is case-sensitive.
If there are other loop-holes, please let me know at saikatdey195@gmail.com
